# Disaster Relief App

A PHP web application developed for UBC's CPSC 304 databases course in collaboration with Gordon Zhou and Andy Xie. This project aims to help coordinate relief efforts during disasters by connecting victims with volunteers and relief centers offering aid. The website is hosted on UBC's undergraduate web servers and uses Oracle SQL for backend data management.

## Connecting to Oracle DB
Add a `config.ini` file to project's root directory with the following, changing "cwl" to your own CWL and `dbpassword` to 'a' + your student number.
```c
[database]
dbuser = "ora_cwl"
dbpassword = "a12345678"
```
